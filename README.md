I just updated the [Xiaoying Riley](https://twitter.com/3rdwave_themes) template to Jekyll and use it as my resume freely hosted on Github Pages.
You can get inspired by my integration but follow the original license of the template.


## Demo
** Original Demo:** https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/resume/free-bootstrap-theme-for-web-developers/

Developer is a free Bootstrap 5 template designed to **help developers promote their work**. 
It can be used as a **professional portal** to your other online portfolios or websites (eg. Linkedin, Blog, GitHub etc) **in a modular fashion**. 
The template comes with all of the **source SCSS files included** so the styling/colour can easily be customised to your taste.

**New Feature - Dark Mode**
